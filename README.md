# SpaceStationX.py
A text-based python game.

## Synopsis
Space Station X is under siege by an unidentified and particularly violent organism. It has already devastated various parts of the station, along with several dear crew members. However, you and the remaining crew have managed to sequester it into an unprimed airlock. Its only exit is open space, and it is currently trying to break its way back into the space station proper. 

Facing the monster and trying to prime the airlock without a suitable weapon will mean certain death for you and your crew. Your only choice is to gather the parts needed to build an impromptu weapon—a flamethrower should do—along with the various supplies needed to prime the airlock and open it, which will get rid of the organism once and for all.

To create your weapon, you will need a CO2 tank from the Hydrogarden, an Air Hose Adapter from the Engineering department, along with a Butane Lighter you have stashed in the Barracks. To heal and protect yourself from harm, you will need Bandages from the Medical Bay and a Space Suit from the Space Walk exit. Finally, to reach the Air Lock and confront the organism, you will need a Plasma Knife from the Mess Room, Access Codes from Central Command, and the Air Lock SDS from Maintenance. Good luck!
